# ANROT-HELANet

**This code repository is still being updated in progress.** 

This is the code repository for our ANROT-HELANet, an extension of our previous HELA-VFA work to be robust to adversarial and natural gaussian noise attacks.

Code repository for HELA-VFA: https://github.com/GreedYLearner1146/HELA-VFA/tree/main 

We utilized the Sicara few-shot library package for running our few-shot algorithm. \
Link to the Sicara Few-Shot github page: https://github.com/sicara/easy-few-shot-learning.

All codes that is and will be shown here are presented in PyTorch format. The backbone for our ANROT-HELANet, like the HELA-VFA, is the ResNet-12.

**(This repo is still be constructed currently. Stay tune for changes.)**
